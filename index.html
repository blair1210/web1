Oh, to see without my eyesOh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River<br>
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me<br>
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
<strong>Blessed</strong> be the mystery of love
Lord, <p>I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received</p><p style="margin-top:10px;">
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried</p>
