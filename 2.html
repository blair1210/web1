Are you okay?
'Cause you're the one who needed space
And finally now I'm doing fine
You would rather see me cry-y-y
Are you okay?
You're acting like we never changed
And finally I can sleep at night
Makes you wanna lose your mind
I know that you've been scared of love
And everything it did to us
But how am I supposed to open up
When you were just so good at closing off?
You're up and down, I'm inside out
You ripped my heart right from my mouth
And then I had to go and pick it up
And play it like I didn't give a fuck
You called up my phone fifty times from that party
3AM, you thought I'd be there in a heartbeat
It's your life but you might wanna put down the Bacardi
Mean this sincerely, dude
Are you okay?
'Cause you're the one who needed space
And finally now I'm doing fine
You would rather see me cry-y-y
